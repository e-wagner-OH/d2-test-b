  ## Requirements
  Before starting the integration, ensure you have the following:

  - **Epic EMR Access**: Ensure you have the necessary credentials and permissions.
  - **Vendor API Documentation**: Obtain the API documentation from the vendor.
  - **Internal System Specifications**: Gather details about the internal systems that will connect to Epic EMR.

  ## Integration Steps
  Follow these steps to integrate the systems:

  1. **Initial Setup**
      - Clone the integration repository:
          ```bash
          git clone https://github.com/healthcare-org/integration-repo.git
          ```
      - Navigate to the project directory:
          ```bash
          cd integration-repo
          ```
      - Install dependencies:
          ```bash
          npm install
          ```

  2. **Configure Internal Systems**
      - Update the configuration file with internal system details:
          ```json
          {
              "system": "internal-system",
              "endpoint": "https://internal-system.example.com/api"
          }
          ```

  3. **Connect to Epic EMR**
      - Use the provided API keys to authenticate with Epic EMR:
          ```bash
          export EPIC_API_KEY=your_epic_api_key
          ```

  4. **Integrate Vendor Services**
      - Add vendor service endpoints to the configuration:
          ```json
          {
              "vendor": "vendor-service",
              "endpoint": "https://vendor-service.example.com/api"
          }
          ```

  ## Testing
  Ensure the integration works correctly by performing the following tests:

  - **Unit Tests**: Run unit tests to verify individual components.
      ```bash
      npm test
      ```
  - **Integration Tests**: Conduct integration tests to ensure all systems work together.
      ```bash
      npm run integration-test
      ```
